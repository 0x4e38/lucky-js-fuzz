**PS**

I am not a pro on writing Javascript, and this fuzzer was written in a hurry. So the project is written in a very old yet ugly '90s style.

It was formerly going to be used for fuzzing NScript, a script evaluation engine used in the Windows Defender, so there're only basic data type supported here. I will update often as I am prepare to use this to do more fuzzing work in the future.
